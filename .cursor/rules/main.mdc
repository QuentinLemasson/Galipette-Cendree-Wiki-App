# Architecture

Code architecture follow a classic NextJS folder app

|
|---> prisma
|---> public
|---> src
    |---> app
    |---> components
    |---> store
    |---> hooks
    |---> types
    |---> utils

# Component

Only use fonction components.
Keep the component's file size to a maximum of 200 lines.
Each component have to adress a single specific function.
Document each component with jsdoc, and a quick summary of the component's function.

# UseEffect Usage

Keep the useEffect usage as minimal as possible.
If applicable, prefer handling logic inside event handlers or reducers.

If the use of useEffect is unavoidable, encapsulate it inside a custom hook in @src/hooks

# Re-Rendering

Try to optimize the components, events, reducers, etc to avoid unessessary renderings. 
Use memoÃ¯zation if needed.

# Libraries

Do not use external libraries not already included in the project, unless explicitly asked.
You can suggest new libraries, but wait for confirmation to use it.

# Config

- Tailwind => [tailwind.config.ts](mdc:tailwind.config.ts)
